### Welcome to the code repository for this codebase, a fork of tgstation.

## Community
Discord is the place where most of the discussion happens, due to absence of a forum. Here you can contact administrators, ask mentors for help, or simply discuss your rounds. It is also a place where you can find links to ban appeals, admin applications and others, which could be really useful.

**Space Station 13** is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive!
